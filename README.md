## Simple Book Lending App (C# with Microsoft Access Database)
The Simple Book Lending App is a basic application developed in C# with a Microsoft Access database backend. This project serves as a foundational example of library management systems, showcasing core concepts of database management, user interface design, and file handling in C#.

## Key Features:
Book Management: Users can add, edit, and delete books from the library collection. Each book entry includes details such as title, author, genre, and availability status.

Member Management: The application allows administrators to manage library members by adding, updating, and removing member information. Each member has a unique identifier, name, contact details, and borrowing history.

Borrowing and Returning Books: Users can borrow books from the library collection, with the system tracking borrowing dates and due dates. Upon returning a book, the system updates its availability status and maintains borrowing history.

Search and Filtering: The application includes search and filtering functionalities, enabling users to quickly find books based on various criteria such as title, author, or genre.

## Technologies Used:
C# Programming Language: The core logic and functionality of the application are implemented using C#.
Windows Forms (WinForms): The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed using Windows Forms, providing a familiar and intuitive user experience.
Microsoft Access Database: The application utilizes a Microsoft Access database to store and manage book and member information. Access provides a lightweight and accessible database solution for small-scale applications.
ADO.NET (ActiveX Data Objects .NET): ADO.NET is used to establish connections to the Access database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve or modify data.

##Getting Started:
To run the Simple Book Lending App locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
Ensure that you have Microsoft Access installed on your system.
Update the database connection string in the application code to point to your Microsoft Access database file.
Build and run the application.

## Future Enhancements:
While the Simple Book Lending App provides basic functionality for library management, future enhancements could include:
Integration with a more robust database management system (e.g., SQL Server) to support larger-scale applications.
Implementation of additional features such as fine management, reservation system, and user authentication.
Improved error handling, validation, and exception management to enhance the application's robustness and reliability.
